## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking me out! This is a work-in-progress "about me".

I changed over into the technology sector in late 2023. Since then I have obtained my A+, N+, PCEP, and completed various courses like IBM's AI Developer and Google IT Automation with Python.
While I am new to the sector, I quickly fell in love with programming while trying to automate things at work, and once I started delving into AI it was done for.

This repo is a collection of open-source projects based on "ideas made reality", anytime I wonder if I can make something to do a thing, I'm gonna try it and put it here.

I am open for collaboration on projects, as well as any helpful tips/tricks/advice you can give me! I'm here to learn as much as I am to expirement.

So far I have gained experience in Python, Powershell, Bash, and HTML5
